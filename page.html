	<h1>Flash 3D Space Simulation</h1>
	<h3>by Peter Thelander</h3>
<p></p>This is just a small shockwave flash program I've written. It's like a mini-galaxy simulator. 
<p></p>
It shows an example of point-of-view and movement code, and you can now use the usual game control keys W,A,S,D to move around (also Q,E for roll). The text in the upper left is the projection matrix, representing the eye position and orientation.
<p></p>
Right now it's just a little toy program for playing around with the 3-d framework concepts in flash. The goal later is to develop it into a bit more of a game, possibly with enemy ships to dogfight (easier said than done).
<p></p>
This was developed using the Flashdevelop IDE, combined with Haxe to generate the swf. Thank you to the authors of those excellent pieces of software!
<p></p>
By the way, notice the black hole that seems to form at the centre of the galaxy: that happened by accident, for a completely different reason than in the real galaxy - this one is nothing to do with gravity, it's just rounding errors :-)
<p></p>Like it? Send me feedback at peter dot thelander at gmail dot com, it will help keep me motivated to develop this further.
<p></p>Don't forget to set the browser to full screen (usually F11), then you can run the swf file by <a href="MyHaxeProject.swf">clicking here</a>.
